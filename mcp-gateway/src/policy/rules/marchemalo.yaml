# Marchemalo Policy: Business rules for Linear issue creation
# CAB-876: Les tickets Urgent/High doivent etre dans un cycle
#
# Use case:
#   - An AI agent calls Linear:create_issue to create a ticket
#   - If priority is 1 (Urgent) or 2 (High) AND cycle is null/absent
#   - The request is BLOCKED with a policy violation
#
# This prevents urgent tickets from being created without sprint planning.
